# Deep_Learning
A directory of my deep learning projects.

## Research
I research deep reinforcement learning at Brown University under Michael Littman. These are projects I've done in the lab:

- [Adversarial Video Generation](https://github.com/dyelax/Adversarial_Video_Generation): A TensorFlow Implementation of "Deep Multi-Scale Video Prediction Beyond Mean Square Error" by Mathieu, Couprie & LeCun.

## Personal
I mess around with neural nets in my free time to learn new things and create cool AI art:

- [encore.ai](https://github.com/dyelax/encore.ai): Generate new lyrics in the style of any artist using LSTMs and TensorFlow.
