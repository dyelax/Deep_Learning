# Deep Learning
A directory of my deep learning projects.

## NVIDIA
For the spring of 2017 I will be working on deep learning projects as a Solution Architect Intern at NVIDIA.

## Research
I research deep reinforcement learning at Brown University under Michael Littman. These are projects I've done in the lab:

- [Adversarial Video Generation](https://github.com/dyelax/Adversarial_Video_Generation): A TensorFlow Implementation of "Deep Multi-Scale Video Prediction Beyond Mean Square Error" by Mathieu, Couprie & LeCun.

## Personal
I mess around with neural nets in my free time to learn new things and create cool AI art:

- [encore.ai](https://github.com/dyelax/encore.ai): Generate new lyrics in the style of any artist using LSTMs and TensorFlow. (Winner – Best ML Hack, HackMIT 2016.)
- Autonomous Driving: I was accepted into the innaugural class of Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree Program (4.5% acceptance rate)
  - [Behavioral Cloning](https://github.com/dyelax/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning): Used Keras and Deep CNNs to train a behavioral cloning network to predict steering angles from images based on samples of my driving.
  - [Lane Detection](https://github.com/dyelax/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Finding): Used classical computer vision to detect lane lines, curvature and car position from camera images in various lighting conditions.
